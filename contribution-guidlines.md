# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Coursefy! I appreciate your interest in helping improve our application. Coursefy is currently in early development and made with only using Godot Engine, requiring refactoring and the establishment of a flexible, robust architecture to facilitate easy upgrades without breaking the existing project for future feature requirements.

Now if you don't know Godot and want to contribute you can do that by reporting issues and proposing new features.
